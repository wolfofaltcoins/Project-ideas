# Project-ideas

1. Make a smart contract that checks the last time you had activity in a wallet. If the wallet hasn't had activity in over 3 months the smart contract will withdraw all liquidity from the pools, sell the farm tokens and move any usdc or blue chip tokens to a centralized exchange where they can be withdrawn through beneficieries.

2. Make a wrapper around metamask that allows me to store all the token addresses, allows me to search for token addresses. Allows me to search for abi, allows me to set a max gas price.

3. Make a token extension that allows me to serach rpcs, token addresses etc without going to a website.

4. Make a frontend that allows people to auto harvest, dump or compound from any farm.
